## Information
I got tired of having to hunt down every material one-by-one when changing min/max brightness values on shaders like [lilToon](https://github.com/lilxyzw/lilToon), so I created a tool to easily manage these values for each material used on the avatar. Will add support for more shaders over time. 
### Currently Supported Shaders
- [Poiyomi Toon 8.1](https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader)
- [lilToon](https://github.com/lilxyzw/lilToon)

The latest release is available [here](https://github.com/medylme/ShaderBrightnessManager/releases/latest).

## License
This tool is available as-is under [MIT](https://github.com/medylme/ShaderBrightnessManager/blob/main/LICENSE).
